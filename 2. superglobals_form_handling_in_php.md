# Understanding Superglobals & Form Handling in PHP

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
- Explain what `$_POST`, `$_GET`, `$_REQUEST`, and `$_SERVER` are
- Use `$_POST` and `$_GET` to collect form data
- Understand when each superglobal is used
- Detect form submission using `$_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"]`
- Handle both GET and POST forms in PHP
- Print server and request info for debugging and understanding

## 📚 Superglobals Overview

### 🔸 `$_POST`
- Used to collect data from forms submitted with `method="post"`
```php
$name = $_POST['name'];  // Gets the value of the input with name="name"
```

### 🔸 `$_GET`
- Used to get data sent via the URL (e.g., `?name=Lisa`)
```php
$name = $_GET['name'];
```

### 🔸 `$_REQUEST`
- Contains both `$_GET` and `$_POST`
```php
$name = $_REQUEST['name'];
```

### 🔸 `$_SERVER`
- Contains server/environment info
```php
$method = $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'];  // Returns "GET" or "POST"
```

## 📝 Full HTML + PHP Example: POST Form

```php
<form method="post">
  <input name="username" placeholder="Your name"><br>
  <textarea name="comment" placeholder="Your comment"></textarea><br>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>

<?php
// Check if form was submitted using POST
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
  // Get and display the submitted data
  $username = $_POST['username'];      // get input from field named "username"
  $comment = $_POST['comment'];        // get input from field named "comment"

  echo "Name: " . htmlspecialchars($username) . "<br>";   // Print name safely
  echo "Comment: " . htmlspecialchars($comment);          // Print comment safely
}
?>
```

### 🔍 Line-by-line explanation:
- `<form method="post">` – The form will send its data using the POST method.
- `<input name="username">` – Text field where the user types their name. The name attribute is important because PHP uses it to find the data.
- `<textarea name="comment">` – Multi-line input for the user’s comment.
- `<button type="submit">` – Button to send the form.
- `$_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"]` – Checks if the form was submitted via POST.
- `$_POST['username']` – Access the value from the input field with `name="username"`.
- `htmlspecialchars(...)` – Protects from malicious input like HTML or JavaScript injection.

## 📘 GET Form Example

```php
<form method="get">
  <input name="username" placeholder="Your name"><br>
  <input name="age" placeholder="Your age"><br>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>

<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "GET") {
  $username = $_GET['username'];
  $age = $_GET['age'];

  echo "Name: " . htmlspecialchars($username) . "<br>";
  echo "Age: " . htmlspecialchars($age);
}
?>
```

### 🔍 Explanation:
- `method="get"` – Data is sent in the URL (e.g., `?username=Lisa&age=16`)
- `$_GET` – Used to access values submitted via GET
- Same security function `htmlspecialchars()` is used

## 🔧 Debug Tool: Print Superglobals

```php
<pre>
<?php
print_r($_POST);      // Show contents of $_POST
print_r($_GET);       // Show contents of $_GET
print_r($_REQUEST);   // Show both POST and GET
print_r($_SERVER);    // Show server info
?>
</pre>
```

Use this after submitting a form to inspect the data sent and how PHP stores it.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Summary

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `method="post"` | Sends data invisibly in the request body |
| `method="get"` | Sends data visibly in the URL |
| `$_POST` | Contains POSTed data |
| `$_GET` | Contains GET data |
| `$_REQUEST` | Contains both POST and GET |
| `$_SERVER` | Server info including request method |
| `htmlspecialchars()` | Prevents script injection |

---

## ✅ Challenge Task

Create a form that:
- Uses POST method
- Accepts name and comment
- Displays submitted data with formatting
- Detects and shows the request method
- Uses `htmlspecialchars()` on all output

## 🐞 Debugging with Superglobals – Step-by-Step Guide

### 🎯 Goal:
Use `print_r()` and `<pre>` to see what data PHP receives when forms are submitted.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Use `<pre>` and `print_r()`

**Why?**  
- `print_r()` shows what's inside arrays like `$_POST` and `$_GET`.
- `<pre>` makes it readable in the browser.

**Code:**
```php
<pre>
<?php
  print_r($_POST);
  print_r($_GET);
  print_r($_REQUEST);
  print_r($_SERVER);
?>
</pre>
```

---

### 📋 Full Working Example

```php
<form method="post">
  <input name="name" placeholder="Your name">
  <textarea name="comment" placeholder="Your comment"></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>

<pre>
<?php
  echo "==== POST ====";
  print_r($_POST);

  echo "==== GET ====";
  print_r($_GET);

  echo "==== REQUEST ====";
  print_r($_REQUEST);

  echo "==== SERVER ====";
  print_r($_SERVER);
?>
</pre>
```

### 🔍 What You'll See

#### 1. `$_POST`
```
==== POST ====
Array
(
    [name] => Alice
    [comment] => Hello world!
)
```

#### 2. `$_GET`
(empty if using POST)

#### 3. `$_REQUEST`
Shows both GET and POST:
```
Array
(
    [name] => Alice
    [comment] => Hello world!
)
```

#### 4. `$_SERVER` (partial)
```
Array
(
    [REQUEST_METHOD] => POST
    [SCRIPT_NAME] => /form.php
    ...
)
```

### 🧠 What You Can Learn
| Check This | Learn What |
|------------|-------------|
| `$_POST` | Form fields using POST |
| `$_GET` | Form fields using GET or URL |
| `$_REQUEST` | Combined POST/GET fields |
| `$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']` | Whether form used GET or POST |
| `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']` | Which file was run |
| `$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']` | Browser used to send request |

---

### ✅ Use in Class

Place the debug block at the bottom of your form file:

```php
<pre>
<?php
  print_r($_POST);
  print_r($_GET);
  print_r($_REQUEST);
  print_r($_SERVER);
?>
</pre>
```

Submit a form, and ask:
- What values were sent?
- Did PHP receive them?
- What method was used?
- What browser or path was used?

This helps students (and you) understand **how data travels between browser and PHP**.
