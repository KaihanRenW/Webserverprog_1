# Lesson 5: Sessions, Cookies, and Client–Server Basics

## 🧠 Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson, students (and you) should be able to:
- Use `$_SESSION` to store data across pages
- Understand the difference between sessions and cookies
- Understand how HTTP requests and responses work
- Recognize the role of the client and the server in a web app

## 📁 Overview of Files Used

| Filename        | Purpose                              |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `index.php`     | Main file that shows session info    |
| `login.php`     | Form for entering a name             |
| `logout.php`    | Clears the session                   |

## 🧠 Concept: What is a Session?

A **session** lets us store user-specific data **on the server**. It stays available while the user is browsing.

Example: If a user types their name once, we can remember it on every page.

---

## 🔐 How to Start a Session

You must always put this **at the top** of every PHP file that uses `$_SESSION`:

```php
<?php
session_start();
?>
```

This tells PHP to start or continue the current session. If you forget this line, session data will not work!

---

## 📁 File 1: login.php – Form to Save the Name

```php
<?php
session_start();

if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
  if (!empty($_POST["name"])) {
    $_SESSION["username"] = htmlspecialchars($_POST["name"]);
    header("Location: index.php");  // go back to main page
    exit();
  }
}
?>

<form method="post">
  <input name="name" placeholder="Enter your name">
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

### 📌 What this does:
- Starts a session
- If user submits the form, their name is saved in `$_SESSION["username"]`
- `header("Location: index.php")` redirects to the main page

---

## 📁 File 2: index.php – Show User Info

```php
<?php
session_start();
?>

<h2>Welcome</h2>

<?php
if (isset($_SESSION["username"])) {
  echo "<p>Hello, " . htmlspecialchars($_SESSION["username"]) . "!</p>";
  echo '<a href="logout.php">Logout</a>';
} else {
  echo '<p>You are not logged in. <a href="login.php">Login here</a></p>';
}
?>
```

---

## 📁 File 3: logout.php – Clear Session

```php
<?php
session_start();
session_destroy();
header("Location: index.php");
exit();
```

### 📌 What this does:
- Starts session
- Destroys all session data
- Sends user back to the main page

## 🔍 What is the Difference Between Sessions and Cookies?

| Feature         | Session                          | Cookie                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Stored in...    | Server (only ID in browser)      | User's browser                  |
| Lifetime        | Until browser closes or logout   | Can be set to expire in days    |
| Secure?         | More secure                      | Can be read by user             |
| Access in PHP   | `$_SESSION`                      | `$_COOKIE`                      |

## 🌐 Client–Server Explanation

When you visit a website:

1. **Browser** (client) sends a request to the **server**
2. Server processes PHP code and sends **HTML back**
3. If the form uses POST, the browser sends data to the server
4. The server can:
   - Save the data
   - Read from files
   - Use sessions
   - Generate new HTML and send it back

This is the request/response cycle.

## 📂 Folder Structure Example

```
/your-folder
├── index.php
├── login.php
├── logout.php
```

## ✅ Summary

You’ve learned how to:
- Store user info in a session using `$_SESSION`
- Use `session_start()` and `session_destroy()`
- Redirect using `header(...)`
- Understand how client–server communication works

Next: we’ll start planning and organizing the full mini project using what we’ve learned!
